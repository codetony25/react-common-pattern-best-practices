## Getting Started 
* think simple, think modular, think re-use, and for the the love of god, don't overthink it and be patient.

Questions to ask yourself.

* What happens when you call setState?
  
* What’s the difference between an Element and a Component in React?
  
* When would you use a Class Component over a Functional Component?
  
* What are refs in React and why are they important?
  
* What are keys in React and why are they important?
  
* If you created a React element like Twitter below, what would the component definition of Twitter look like?
  
* In which lifecycle event do you make AJAX requests and why?
  
* What does shouldComponentUpdate do and why is it important?
  
* How do you tell React to build in Production mode and what will that do?
  
* Describe how events are handled in React.
  
* What is the second argument that can optionally be passed to setState and what is its purpose?
  
* Compare and contrast creating React Components in ES5 and ES2015 (also known as ES6). What are the advantages and disadvantages of using one or the other? Include notes about default props, initial state, PropTypes, and DisplayName.
  
* Explain the Virtual DOM, and a pragmatic overview of how React renders it to the DOM.
  
* Explain the standard JavaScript toolchain, transpilation (via Babel or other compilers), JSX, and these items’ significance in recent development. What sort of tools might you use in the build steps to optimize the compiled output React code?

* Compare and contrast the various React Component lifecycle methods. How might understanding these help build certain interfaces/features?
  
* How would you create Higher Order Components (HOCs) in React?
  
* Compare and contrast incorporating mixins and enforcing modularity in React Components. (extend, createClass and mixins, HOCs) Why would you use these techniques, and what are the drawbacks of each?
  
* What is the significance of keys in React?
  
* What is the significance of refs in React?
  
* Compare and contrast setState() and forceUpdate(). What is the significance of each, and when would you use one or the other? In addition, how might you use any data layer with React (like Backbone, Ember, or Redux)? What are the systemic requirements of doing so?
  
* In a general overview, how might React Router and its techniques differ from more traditional JavaScript routers like Backbone’s Router?
  
* What are pure functional Components?
  
* How might React handle or restrict Props to certain types, or require certain Props to exist?
  
* Which feature can we use to cause a component to render only when its ID changes?
